# Odin Recipes

A basic HTML-only website built as part of [The Odin Project's Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/).  
This project demonstrates fundamental HTML skills including:
- Creating structured webpages
- Linking between pages
- Using semantic elements like headings, lists, paragraphs, and images

## 📁 Project Structure

## 📋 What I Learned

- How to create clean, semantic HTML pages
- How to use lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`) and links (`<a>`)
- Project folder structure and internal page navigation

---

## 🧠 About the Project

Each recipe page contains:
- A title
- Description of the dish
- Ingredients list
- Step-by-step instructions
- A link back to the homepage

No CSS or JavaScript was used — pure HTML as required by the project instructions.

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Add CSS for layout and design
- Use responsive design for mobile-friendliness
- Include JavaScript for interactivity later in the curriculum
